As the sun set over the hills, 5 hikers gathered around a campfire, their backpacks embroidered with letters from A to Z. A quick brown fox darted past 7 chirping crickets and 6 frogs leaping near the 0 degree lake. Overhead, 9 bats flitted through the twilight, while 12 fireflies blinked in rhythm among the trees. The hikers share stories of their 89 mile journey, marveling at the beauty of the 345 wildflowers blooming in the valley. Under the glow of 678 stars, they laughed and embraced the harmony of letters, numbers, and natures wonders.
