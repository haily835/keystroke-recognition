Dear Dr. Lay, I am pleased to invite you to join my CERA colleagues and me at our annual executive conference, Shooting the Rapids, Strategies and Risks for the Energy Future, to be held this February in Houston, Texas. This premier international gathering offers senior executives new ideas, insights, and strategic thinking on the challenges facing the global energy industry. The conference will focus on the implications of current market turmoil for energy strategies, investment, regulatory challenges, competitive dynamics, and industry structure, with presentations covering oil, natural gas, power, and their interconnections across key regions. As the centerpiece of CERAWeek, it also provides opportunities for informal interaction and networking, with last year event drawing executives from over 50 countries. For more details, please visit CERA.com or register at register.cera.com. I hope you will join us. Sincerely, Daniel Yergin Chairman, Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
