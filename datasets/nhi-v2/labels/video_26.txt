Bright fox jumps; Jack packs quartz jugs / lazy dogs quack, dwarves fix vows. Pack my box; bright quartz glows / Jacks lazy fox jumps over dwarves, vexing dogs. Jumpy dwarves quack, bright fox skips; Jack fills the box / with liquor and quartz. Quickly pack my box; lazy dogs bark, quartz shines / and Jacks bright fox jumps. Lazy dogs jump; Jack fixes bright quartz / while dwarves pack liquor jugs, quickly.
