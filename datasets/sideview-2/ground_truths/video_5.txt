john, i left a message about this lastweek, but wanted to follow up with additional information for your review. we have three offerings currently available or coming soon that i feel would compliment the small or mid cap and fixed income exposure you already have through redwood, sequoia, and willow. quantitive allocation, llc integrates for quantitative investment models to drive agressive and potentially leveraged asset allocation decisions. generates exposure to stock and bond markets through indexing techniques and futures transactions. portfolio market exposures can range from plus three hundred percent to minus a hundred percent of net assets. this is clearly different from the largely non leverage stock picker funds you already own. i would consider this to be a predominately large cap investment. i think of it as an index fund with a brain and on steriod call me and i will explain that comment in more detail. juniper crossover fund, llc managed by orbimed advisors, and focused on global biotech and pharma. up to thirty percent participation in private equity. this could be a way to get you some private equity eposure with a world class manager. tamarack international fund, llc long short stock picker fund focused on the international mid cap market. i feel this fund is very similar in style to the managers you already own, but would give you exposure to the international markets that you currently lack. this is a new fund and the first closing will probably in june. of course, the summaries above are for information purposes only and do not constitute an offer to sell or solicatation of an offer to buy interests in these funds. please call me if you are interested in any of the strategies outlined above, and i will have the appropriate offering memorandum sent to you. thanks,
