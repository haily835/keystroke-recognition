event. bill perkins and i have a strong personal and professional relationship. he is an extremely creative individual, highly educated in some domains, who thinks outside the box. bill actually started in february years ago and made the clean market world stand. he has been successful in the gas business, and he has had someone to filter his ideas, providing a normal consulting role to enhance the traffic guide and, considering a while, he comes up with a great one. he pointed out preciosity of piercing currencies of the options market, making it normally and closely, that are isolated into internationals following trade. in return, we agreed to a situation making it last with efforts far. i want to emphasize continuing this relation since being considered a huge priority. i am fulfilling parts of the risk exposure as a cost of doing business. bill understands this, holding things as independent in the market performance and risk rates around trading. someone with finite capital has a very high confidence in bill, not conducting huge risky trades. having said that, we certainly need to monitor risks, credit exposure, and continually remain. just understand the risk, at a different level, happening at any point in investment. there were some concerns regarding the transactional pricing speed of option trade. he was absolutely right about the valuation we know it is well. there are a couple of products that dont do a good job of evaluating because of systematic filters. this proposal created by a research group. the problem with these models is that they are strictly statistical and do not take into account fundamental limitations. for instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, for a transport spread from an external market area to go within variable cost than the models predict. this filter is necessary to apply accurate curvature on the correlation used. obviously, we have this function in our models. i was unaware of this methodology being transferred to date valuation models. this has since been changed, ultimately leading to incidents tending to be extremely rare. a very few investment grade companies have these types of products. bill wanted to do a trade to reduce exposure as personal. i gave mike the goahead to trade without consulting credit. i do not believe in needing anyone reviewing this trade considering circumstances. if you believe differently, please advise. thanks, john.
